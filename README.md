# SkillStream

This project is a full-stack application built with a React frontend and an Express + TypeScript backend.

## Local development

1. **Requirements**
   - Node.js 20+
   - npm 9+
   - PostgreSQL or MySQL database (configure connection in `.env`)

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment variables**
   - Copy `.env` or create your own `.env` file with the necessary database connection string.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This runs both the backend and frontend using Vite with hot module reloading.

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

The project can now be developed locally using any editor such as VS Code.
